# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Natalia Malec-Lachowska

### About me
Iâ€™m a **QA Engineer** with a strong analytical and project background, transitioning into software testing after several years of close collaboration with IT, UX and business teams. I focus on **manual and API testing** and Iâ€™m expanding into **test automation**. I value accuracy, logical thinking and detail orientation, and Iâ€™m driven by continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
